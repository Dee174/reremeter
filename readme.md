Reremeter is an handheld and low-cost discrete near infrared reflectance spectrometer and a machine learning algorithm developed to detect different types of plastic. Watch our [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrVgNUm2_Jo) to find out more!

This repository contains all the files required to build an reremeter from scratch, and you can use them to make your own version. Please take note that this work is published under GPL-3.0. 

### How to get started
A guide on how to get started with the build of your own reremeter.
- Build your own [hardware](./hardware).
- Build and upload the [firmware](./firmware).
- Collect data of your samples (or check out our example [dataset](./data)).
- Make Predictions using our provided Python [scripts](./software).
- Visualize results in an [UI](./webapp).

### Notes
The reremeter hardware project and according software interfaces are designed and developed by Armin Straller. It is a part of the [RealRecycling](https://re-re.org) initiative by Bernhard Gessler and Armin Straller.
